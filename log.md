# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 11, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Today I choose what to code in this 100 day code challenge. So I decided to complete Front end development that inclde HTML5, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, JS, REACT, ANGULAR. I also decided to enroll in certification course and complete it in 100 days and I enrolled in Resposive web development certification course (duration 300 hours) from FreeCodeCamp.


**Thoughts:** I'm bit excited for my Day 1 I want to make sure my continuity never broke in this duration of #100 Days of Code.
